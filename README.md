### üëã Hi there! I'm Yara

I'm a PhD Candidate and [Gates Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org) at the [Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/yara-kyrychenko), advised by [Sander van der Linden](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/prof-sander-van-der-linden) and [Jon Roozenbeek](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/jon-roozenbeek). I use data and behavioral science methods, like language models and lab experiments, to study the social identity dynamics of socio-technical systems. I'm particularly interested in `social identity`, `social media`, `misinformation`, and `artificial intelligence`. 

üî≠ I'm currently working on:
- What drives intergroup conflict on social media?
    - Russia's war in Ukraine, propaganda, and identity narratives.
    - Hammas' Oct 7 attack on Israel and its consequences for Israeli society and the world. 
- How can we make AI that brings out the best in humanity? 
    - Social identity biases in large language models.
- How can people become more resilient to misinformation online?
    - Profiling misinformation susceptibility worldwide.

I also organize the [Cambridge Social Psychology Seminar Series](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/9110) and co-manage the CSDM Lab. 

üëØ I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting projects and ideas, so please feel free to reach out over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaroslava-kyrychenko/) or email me at yk408 (at) cam (dot) ac (dot) uk!

### üë©‚Äçüíª More about me

In May 2022, I graduated summa cum laude from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) with a double major in Mathematics (Honors) and Psychology. I was an associate research scientist at [Tessa West](https://tessawestlab.hosting.nyu.edu) and [Jay Van Bavel](https://www.jayvanbavel.com/lab)'s labs, where I mainly used data science techniques to study group processes. I'm passionate about advancing and supporting women in science and technology. I write about data science, education, and life on [Medium](https://medium.com/@k.yara). I grew up in Kyiv, Ukraine, and my native languages are Ukrainian and Russian.
