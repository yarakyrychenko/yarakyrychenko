### 👋 Hi there! I'm Yara

I'm a PhD Candidate, Lab Manager, and [Gates Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org) at the [Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab](https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/yara-kyrychenko). I use data and behavioral science methods, like language models and lab experiments, to study the social identity dynamics of socio-technical systems. I'm particularly interested in `intergroup conflict`, `social identity`, `social media`, `misinformation`, and `generative artificial intelligence`. 

🔭 I'm currently working on:
- 🇺🇦 Russia's war in Ukraine, propaganda, and identity narratives on social media. 
- 🤖 Social identity bias in large language models.
- 💬 Misinformation susceptibility and resilience worldwide. 

👯 I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting projects and ideas, so please feel free to reach out over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaroslava-kyrychenko/) or email me at yk408 (at) cam (dot) ac (dot) uk!

### 👩‍💻 More about me

In May 2022, I graduated summa cum laude from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) with a double major in Mathematics (Honors) and Psychology. My math thesis explored data-driven solutions to elliptic partial differential equations and numerical matrix inversion techniques more broadly. 

I was an associate research scientist at [Tessa West](https://tessawestlab.hosting.nyu.edu) and [Jay Van Bavel](https://www.jayvanbavel.com/lab)'s labs, where I mainly used data science techniques to study group processes. I'm passionate about advancing and supporting women in science and technology. I write about data science, education, and life on [Medium](https://medium.com/@k.yara). I grew up in Kyiv, Ukraine, and my native languages are Ukrainian and Russian.
