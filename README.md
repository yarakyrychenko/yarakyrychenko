### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an incoming PhD student in Psychology at the University of Cambridge and a Gates Scholar. I like using data science / nlp techniques to answer questions in social psychology. I'm particualrly interested in intergroup conflict and how social identities develop over time through offline and online experiences. 

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Right now I'm working on a lot of projects relating to the Ukraine-Russia war and identity narratives on social media. 

ðŸ‘¯ I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects and ideas, so please feel free to reach out!
