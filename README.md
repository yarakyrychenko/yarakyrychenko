### Hi there! 👋

I'm an incoming PhD student in Psychology at [the University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) and a [Gates Scholar](https://www.gatescambridge.org). I like using data science / NLP techniques to answer questions in social psychology. I'm particualrly interested in intergroup conflict, misinformation, polarization and social identity formation through offline and online experiences. 

🇺🇦 Right now I'm working on a lot of projects relating to the Ukraine-Russia war and identity narratives on social media. 

👯 I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects and ideas, so please feel free to reach out!

### More about me

In May 2022 I graduated summa cum laude from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu) with a double-major in Mathematics (Honors) and Psychology. My math honors thesis explored data-driven solutions to elliptic partial differential equations and numerical matrix inversion techniques more broadly. I'm a research assistant at [Tessa West](https://tessawestlab.hosting.nyu.edu) and [Jay Van Bavel](https://www.jayvanbavel.com/lab)'s labs where I mostly use data science techniques to study group processes. I'm passionate about advaning and supporitng women in data science and technology.
